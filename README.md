# Titanic-Machine-Learning

## Project Summary
Using data collected from the Titanic, I mathematically modeled the accuracy of two different statistical inference methods, a complex and naive version of baysian modeling. For the titanic dataset, I take into account 3 variables: sex, age, and class. Utilizing Bayes Theorem my code estimates the probability of a person surviving the titanic given the three variables. The complex model assumes that the three variables are related in some way while the naive takes each variable into account separatly. Given a different training size for the models, my code tests the accuracy of the model on other the cases in the data (800 total).

## Result
Graphs are generated using logarithmic values (closer to 0 indicates better performance/more accurate prediciton)
